Once the ADM is stable and the calibration phase is over, we transmition to the atmospheric filter running parralel to the NKF."

    "I'm not sure if the atmospheric filter is technically a \"Kalman Filter\" or a different kind of Filter, as the process model does not rely at all on the last state estimate, but we can still make use of the Kalman filter algorithm and exploit the optimal probability theory for state estimation when there are noisy measurements. The following statement is essentially what the atmospheric filter will do for us: \"If the measured $y_{50}$ doesn't make sense with the ADM (with a known varience), then we shouldn't trust our measurement and we should rely more on the model.\" Specifically, the measurement could be poor due to large cross-track or radial errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal estimate for $y_{50}$ and its varience coming out of the atmospheric filter for each iteration can be mapped into a measurement $t_{50}$ and its varience, which is the measurement inputted into the navigational filter. I am still not exactly sure how we want to deal with the varience of $t_{50}$. It might be best to map the tanh() fit into the time domain and do the curve slide/$\\chi^2+1$ test, since we know this does a good job determining the precision of the measurement based on brightness. In this case, do we need to feed through the varience of the $y_{50}$ estimate into the navigational filter?"
