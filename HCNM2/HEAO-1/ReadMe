Abstract:
    The  HEAO A-1 X-Ray  Source Catalog is  a compilation of  data for 842
    sources  detected with the U. S.  Naval Research Laboratory Large Area
    Sky  Survey Experiment  flown aboard  the HEAO  1 satellite.  The data
    include source identifications, positions,  error  boxes,  mean  X-ray
    intensities, and cross identifications to other source designations.

Introduction:
    The primary  objective of  the Naval  Research Laboratory  (NRL) Large
    Area Sky  Survey Experiment (LASS)  flown aboard the  HEAO 1 satellite
    was to conduct  an all-sky survey  for the brightest  X-ray sources in
    the energy  range 0.25 to 25 keV.  The instrumentation consisted of an
    array of  large  proportional  counter  modules  with  collimators  of
    varying fields of view  and  with  sufficient  sensitivity  to  detect
    sources as faint as 0.25 mu.Jy at 5 keV, assuming a Crab-like spectrum
    (1.1 muJy at 5 keV =  1  UFU  for  a  Crab-like  spectrum).  Full  sky
    coverage was achieved  in  the  first  6  months  of  the  mission  by
    continuously scanning great circles  perpendicular  to  the  Earth-Sun
    line.  The HEAO A-1 catalog results from the 6-month survey and, thus,
    covers  the whole sky.  For additional information  concerning the NRL
    LASS instrument, the data  analysis  procedures,  characteristics  and
    limitations of the source data,  and  a  discussion  of  X-ray  source
    classes, the source publication should be consulted.

Note (1):
    The source coordinates (center of error box) are given in degrees and
    in sexagesimal form. The subscripted right ascensions and declinations
    (right ascension_1-4, declination_1-4) give the positions of the 95
    percent confidence error box surrounding each source. All positions
    are for equinox B1950.0.
Note (2):
    The apparent intensity of the source in counts/sq.cm/s for 0.5 - 25
    keV. The determination of the errors is described in Section III of
    the source reference (Wood et al. 1984). As explained in that paper,
    an intensity of 10**-3. counts/sq.cm/s, which is the limiting flux in
    the catalog, corresponds to 3.3*10**-12 ergs/sq.cm/s in 2-10 keV, both
    for a Crab-like spectrum, meaning that 10**-3 counts/sq.cm/s in HEAO
    A-1 is equivalent to 0.20 UFU or to 0.22 muJy at 5.2 keV, again for a
    Crab-like spectrum.
Note (3):
    The first seven fields (bytes 150-239) contain alternate designations
    of each source in other X-ray catalogs, while the last four fields are
    for non-X-ray cross identifications. Catalog identifications and
    references are given in Table 5 of the source paper. Cross
    identifications were selected according to certain criteria. For X-ray
    catalogs (4U, 2A, 1M, etc.), where error boxes of up to several
    degrees are sometimes reported, the cross reference is given whenever
    the other error box intersects the HEAO A-1 error box. Identifiers are
    also given in certain cases where boxes do not strictly intersect but
    are sufficiently close to suggest a possible relationship. The
    criterion used is that the separation between box centers must be less
    than the sum of the two largest dimensions. The designation XRS (not
    included in Table 5, but described in text) is from Amnuel, Guseinov,
    and Rakhamimov (1979), 4hich summarizes much of the older X-ray
    literature.

    Non-X-ray cross identifications were made on several bases. Whenever
    an identification has been firmly established, for example, by a
    precise position from a modulation collimator or from the Einstein
    Observatory, it is always shown, but so are many additional tentative
    identifications. Some of these have been suggested by earlier work (in
    which case the earlier literature appears either in Table 5 or Table 6
    of the source reference) and the remainder have been found by
    searching the non-X-ray catalogs listed by the authors in their Table
    5. Additional information on selection criteria will be found on page
    647 of the source reference.

    Whenever an (R) appears in the last field, additional references and
    comments will be found in Table 6 of the source reference. Those
    entries are intended primarily to provide a sketch of the basic
    background and current state of knowledge concerning the sources, to
    direct users to further literature, and to clarify ambiguities. They
    are not intended to be a comprehensive bibliography and many
    references are omitted. A special effort has been made to provide
    cross references to other HEAO 1 literature wherever possible, since
    other HEAO 1 observations are simultaneous with and complementary to
    those in the catalog.

History:
    The HEAO A-1 X-Ray Source Catalog was received on magnetic tape by the
    National Space Science Data Center on 20 July 1984 from Dr. Kent S.
    Wood of the Naval Research Laboratory. The tape was in VAX VMS BACKUP
    format with variable length logical and physical records, plus special
    control words (logical record length of each record in the first four
    bytes.) A program was written to convert the records to fixed length
    and the tape file was processed to disk storage on the IBM 3081
    computer of the NASA Space and Earth Sciences Computing Center at
    GSFC. The format of the file was identical to Table 4 of the published
    catalog, meaning that there were 10 sources per group (page in the
    published catalog), separated by column headings and blank records,
    etc. All blank, text, and separator records were removed with an
    editor, leaving just four records per source. A format was designed
    that rearranged the data in logical order for a single record per
    source structure, and a program was written and executed to reformat
    the data. The advantages of the single record per source structure are
    that all records are entirely uniform and the catalog can be sorted
    and searched easily.

    The original catalog contained the error box positions in both decimal
    and sexagesimal form. The latter data were omitted during the
    conversion in order to decrease the final record length, since the
    sexagesimal data can be reconstructed easily from the decimal
    positions given.

Acknowledgments:
    Appreciation is expressed to Kent Wood for communicating about the
    catalog in 1986 and for supplying multiple copies of the source paper.
    Dr. Warren also thanks Dr. Wood for reviewing and commenting on a
    draft version of this document.

    The help of Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
    Astrophysics is also gratefully acknowledged. Dr. McDowell requested a
    machine-readable copy of the catalog and made suggestions about the
    proposed format, including the elimination of the redundant error box
    positions in sexagesimal form.

    The catalog was edited and the documentation prepared by Dr. Wayne
    Warren. It was translated from Script to ASCII and put in the current
    standard form by the undersigned.
