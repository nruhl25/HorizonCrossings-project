# HorizonCrossings-Summer22

## Author: Nathaniel Ruhl

### This repository contains code written for the Horizon Crossings Navigational project at Haverford College. Below are the contents:

- nruhl_final_project/ contains a toy model of a horizon crossing. The paper within, "phys304_nruhl_final_paper.pdf", explains how the toy model works.
- HCNM2/ contains a new version of the entire HCNM software, which was originally written in Nathaniel Ruhl's "HorizonCrossings-" github repository. The flow chart "HCNM2.pdf" displays the process.

##### When working in HCNM2/ and nruhl_final_project/, they must both be working directories.
